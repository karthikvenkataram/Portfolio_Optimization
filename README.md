Portfolio_Optimization
=======================

The agenda of the project is to identify stocks from a list for investmnet such that the algorithm smartly identifies the safer ones to invest with. 
That said these identified stocks should yeild maximum returns and minimum risks. So this is defined as Sharpe Ratio

Efficient Frontier, Min Variance and Mean Variance Methods are used to evaluate stocks to yeild maximum Sharpe Ratio.

Of these, the Efficient Frontier method faired well with highest Sharpe Ratio.

In a nut-shell, the algorithm was developed using python in Jupyter Notebook.

Libraries Used:
pandas
numpy
matplot
seaborn
